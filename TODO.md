1. emails as a object not working switching to username instead
2. Not responsive =)

# Login Page

1. Buttons/Anchor tags need to be more user friendly with on hover events
2. User needs to know input errors.

# Create Account

1. Same state as login state but with post if endpoint exist username is taken
2. replace email with username
3. add confirm password input
4. Buttons/Anchor tags need to be more user friendly with on hover events
5. Maybe add a model or span for username taken somewhere
